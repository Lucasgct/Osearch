== Painless contexts

A Painless script is evaluated within a context. Each context has values that
are available as local variables, an allowlist that controls the available
classes, and the methods and fields within those classes (API), and
if and what type of value is returned.

A Painless script is typically executed within one of the contexts in the table
below. Note this is not necessarily a comprehensive list as custom plugins and
specialized code may define new ways to use a Painless script.
