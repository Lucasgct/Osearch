// TEST[skip: will fail as synced flush is deprecated]

When you perform a synced flush, check the response to make sure there are
no failures. Synced flush operations that fail due to pending indexing
operations are listed in the response body, although the request itself
still returns a 200 OK status. If there are failures, reissue the request.

// TODO(OpenSearch): Correct the version number
Note that synced flush is deprecated. A flush
has the same effect as a synced flush on OpenSearch 7.6 or later.
