The `/etc/opensearch` directory contains the default runtime configuration
for {opensearch}. The ownership of this directory and all contained files are set to
`root:opensearch` on package installations.

The `setgid` flag applies group permissions on the `/etc/opensearch`
directory to ensure that {opensearch} can read any contained files and subdirectories.
All files and subdirectories inherit the `root:opensearch` ownership.
Running commands from this directory or any subdirectories, such as the
<<secure-settings,elasticsearch-keystore tool>>, requires `root:opensearch`
permissions.

OpenSearch loads its configuration from the
`/etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml` file by default.  The format of this
config file is explained in <<settings>>.
