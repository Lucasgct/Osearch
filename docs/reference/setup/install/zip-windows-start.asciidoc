==== Running {opensearch} from the command line

{opensearch} can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
--------------------------------------------

If you have password-protected the {es} keystore, you will be prompted to
enter the keystore's password. See <<secure-settings>> for more details.

By default, {opensearch} runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
