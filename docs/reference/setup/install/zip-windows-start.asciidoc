==== Running OpenSearch from the command line

OpenSearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\opensearch.bat
--------------------------------------------

If you have password-protected the {es} keystore, you will be prompted to
enter the keystore's password. See <<secure-settings>> for more details.

By default, OpenSearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
