==== Running as a daemon

To run OpenSearch as a daemon, specify `-d` on the command line, and record
the process ID in a file using the `-p` option:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/opensearch -d -p pid
--------------------------------------------

If you have password-protected the {opensearch} keystore, you will be prompted
to enter the keystore's password. See <<secure-settings>> for more
details.

Log messages can be found in the `$OPENSEARCH_HOME/logs/` directory.

To shut down OpenSearch, kill the process ID recorded in the `pid` file:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
pkill -F pid
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: The {opensearch} `.tar.gz` package does not include the `systemd` module. To
manage {opensearch} as a service, use the <<start-deb,Debian>> or <<start-rpm,RPM>>
package instead.
