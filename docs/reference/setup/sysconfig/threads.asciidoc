=== Number of threads

{opensearch} uses a number of thread pools for different types of operations.
It is important that it is able to create new threads whenever needed. Make
sure that the number of threads that the {opensearch} user can create is at
least 4096.

This can be done by setting <<ulimit,`ulimit -u 4096`>> as root before
starting {opensearch}, or by setting `nproc` to `4096` in
<<limits.conf,`/etc/security/limits.conf`>>.

The package distributions when run as services under `systemd` will configure
the number of threads for the {opensearch} process automatically. No
additional configuration is required.
