Your data is important to you. Keeping it safe and available is important
to {es}. Sometimes your cluster may experience hardware failure or a power
loss. To help you plan for this, {es} offers a number of features
to achieve high availability despite failures.

* With proper planning, a cluster can be
  <<high-availability-cluster-design,designed for resilience>> to many of the
  things that commonly go wrong, from the loss of a single node or network
  connection right up to a zone-wide outage such as power loss.

* The last line of defence against data loss is to take
  <<backup-cluster,regular snapshots>> of your cluster so that you can restore
  a completely fresh copy of it elsewhere if needed.
