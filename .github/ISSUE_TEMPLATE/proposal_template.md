<!-- 
Welcome to the OpenSearch project!
 - Search for existing issues before creating duplicate proposals
 - Try to provide as much detail as possible
 - Please delete the comments before posting 
 - When opening a feature request you should expect to contribute a solution or part of this to make it a reality. 
 - Think of this like a requirements doc a product manager may fill out but with less rigor typically

-->
