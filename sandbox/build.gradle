/*
 * This module provides a space called inside OpenSearch for the community to easily experiment new ideas and innovate.
 * Ideally, this is where an experimental features will reside before it can be promoted to the corresponding directory
 * in the project root. The sandbox gradle module contains three subdirectories, that mirror the root libs, modules and
 * plugins directories, each with similar intention.
 *
 * All artifacts from the sandbox/libs and sandbox/modules will be included in the snapshot distributions only. During
 * assembling distributions, we will check if the following two conditions are met to include these,

 * 1. The distribution is a snapshot i.e. the build system property build.snapshot is set to true. We use this because,
 * it will prevent accidental bundling of these modules in a release distribution.
 *
 * 2. The sandbox.enabled system property is set to true. This new extra flag is added because we can exclude the
 * modules from the snapshots if needed. For instance, we may want to run performance tests on snapshots without the
 * sandbox modules.
 *
 * To build the distributions without the sandbox modules,
 *   ./gradlew assemble -Denable.sandbox=false
 * Similarly we can run OpenSearch from source without the sandbox modules
 *   ./gradlew run -Denable.sandbox=false
