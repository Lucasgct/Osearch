/**
 * * This class represents a basic permission store. A permission store should be a data structure which
 * supports add, get, and delete operations and can store "String : ListofPermission" pairs or simulate this storage.
 * The underlying data structure can be options other than a HashMap as long as the implementation
 * has a way to translate between the required functions and the data structure below.
 *
 * For example, an Array-based solution could be implemented by appending the String to the front of every Permission in
 * the List and then storing the Permissions in a Permission[]. You would also need to implement the add, get, and delete
 * methods to support this structure effectively.
